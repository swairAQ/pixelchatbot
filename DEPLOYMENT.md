## üìù Important Notes

### Environment Variables

Your app uses environment variables for API keys. Make sure to set these in your hosting platform:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` (required)
- `OPENAI_BASE_URL` (optional, for custom endpoints)
- `OPENAI_MODEL` (optional, defaults to gpt-3.5-turbo)

### Files to Deploy

‚úÖ DO deploy:

- `app.py`
- `requirements.txt`
- `README.md`
- `.gitignore`

‚ùå DON'T deploy (already in `.gitignore`):

- `.env` file (use platform secrets instead)
- `conversations.json` (will be created on first use)
- `preferences.json` (will be created on first use)

### Security

- Never commit `.env` files to Git (already in `.gitignore`)
- Use your hosting platform's secrets/environment variables feature
- Keep your API keys private!
